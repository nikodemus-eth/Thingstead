## I. Business Feasibility
This section determines if the organizational conditions for a successful AI deployment exist.
- Clear Problem Definition: Is there a tangible description of the business problem as it relates to cognitive technology goals?
- Organizational Willingness: Is the project sponsor or business owner committed to putting the final model into a production environment?
- Sufficient ROI or Impact: Will the AI solution provide significantly better results (speed, cost, or quality) than the current non-AI (heuristic) method?

## II. Data Feasibility
This section confirms that the "fuel" for the model is accessible and usable.
- Data Availability & Relevance: Is the data required for the model available, and does it measure the specific outcomes you care about?
- Data Access & Quantity: Does the team have authenticated access to a sufficient volume of data to train and test the system?
- Data Quality: Based on initial inspections, is the data of sufficient quality to avoid "garbage-in, garbage-out" scenarios?

## III. Execution Feasibility
This section assesses the practical ability to build and deploy the solution.
- Technology & Skills: Does the team have access to the necessary AI tools (e.g., NLP libraries, cloud hosting) and the expertise to use them?
- Timely Execution: Can the model be developed and integrated within a timeframe that meets business schedule requirements?
- Operational Sense: Does it make technical and financial sense to deploy the model in the intended operational location (e.g., cloud, edge)?

## The Go/No-Go Decision Matrix
Use this table to track the status of the nine critical factors. A "Maybe" or "No-Go" on any factor indicates a need to iterate on Phase I before proceeding.

| Category | Factor | Status | Rationale / Barriers to "Go" |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business | Clear Problem Definition | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Business | Willingness to Change | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Business | Sufficient ROI/Impact | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Data | Relevant Data Exists | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Data | Access & Quantity | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Data | Sufficient Quality | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Execution | Tech & Skills | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Execution | Timely Execution | [Go/No-Go] |  |
| Execution | Operationalization Sense | [Go/No-Go] |  |
