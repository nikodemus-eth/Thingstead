## I. The Heuristic Baseline (Non-AI Approach)
This section establishes the current state of operations. CPMAI requires identifying the "heuristic" or "quick and dirty" method that serves as your baseline.
- Current Non-Cognitive Approach: Describe the manual or rule-based method currently used to address the task.
- Proposed Non-AI Alternatives: List other deterministic or programmatic methods (e.g., if-then rules, standard automation) that could potentially solve the problem.
- Limitations of Non-AI Methods: Detail the specific disadvantages of these alternatives regarding cost, effort, complexity, scalability, or response time.
- Justification for AI: Provide a firm reason why a cognitive approach is required if a non-cognitive solution is already "good enough".

## II. Cognitive Problem Definition
This section translates business desires into tangible AI goals.
- Cognitive Objectives: Enumerate the specific tasks the AI must accomplish (e.g., "Predict likelihood of customer churn" or "Classify support tickets by intent").
- Desired Outcomes: Define the business results using technical terminology, such as specific accuracy rates or a target degree of "lift".
- AI Pattern Selection: Identify which of the Seven Patterns of AI this project implements to guide algorithm selection (e.g., Hyper-personalization or Autonomous Systems).

## III. AI Success Criteria & Differentiation
AI projects are probabilistic, meaning they provide results in ranges of probability rather than binary certainty.
- Superiority Test: In what specific ways must the AI system perform better than a rule-based or human-driven system?
- The "Skeptic's Proof": Define what metrics must be achieved to satisfy team members or stakeholders who are skeptical of using AI for this specific iteration.
- Human-in-the-Loop Requirements: Identify the critical decision-making points where a human must intervene or review the AI's output.
