This artifact acts as the central repository for the project hierarchy, moving from generic objectives to specialized results.

## I. Project Hierarchy Framework
This section defines the levels of abstraction that the project will follow:
- Phases: The six highest levels of the project (Business Understanding through Model Operationalization).
- Generic Tasks: The standard list of activities for each phase (e.g., "Assess Situation").
- Specialized Tasks: The project-specific adaptations of those generic tasks.
- Methodology Artifacts: The actual records, results, and decisions (the other CPMAI Agents) that fulfill the goals of each task.

## II. Iterative Flow & Lifecycle Map
CPMAI phases are mutually iterative; starting one phase does not preclude returning to a previous one if new data or business needs arise.
- Backtracking Logic: Documentation of the triggers that would cause a shift from, for example, Model Development (Phase IV) back to Data Understanding (Phase II).
- User Story Alignment: A mapping of how each CPMAI iteration ties directly to a specific agile user story or sprint.

## III. The Implementation Roadmap
A blank template for the six primary phases, ready to be populated by the project team:
- Phase I: Business Understanding: Defining objectives and success criteria.
- Phase II: Data Understanding: Identifying data needs and initial collection.
- Phase III: Data Preparation: Constructing the final dataset (cleansing, labeling, etc.).
- Phase IV: Model Development: Algorithm selection and training.
- Phase V: Model Evaluation: Assessing metrics against business requirements.
- Phase VI: Model Operationalization: Deployment and long-term governance.
